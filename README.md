# ProjectEstimationSimulator
Examine various influences on Story point estimations



## Basic Ideas:
- Estimate Size, Derive Duration
- Story point estimation estimates relative effort (as we have to pay for effort - so thats what we want to know)
- Time aspect comes in over the velocity
- System should be self correcting

? Wie visualisiern?

## Project goals /ideas

- mitteln unterschiedliche Wege (last3, last 5, mean, median, ohne ausreißer)

- Influences:
  - Always too much/little estimated (constant factor)
  - Estimates gradually bigger/smaller (define % per Sprint = slope)
  - Ausreißer (% Satz definieren)
  
- Team fluctuation (Without, With)
- Team fluctuation


## Steps
- define
  - project duration /total effort?
  - Effort possible / Sprint
  - define max effort bucket + max Stpts
  
- create random series of real work effort 
  - modify effort according to Influences
- Calculate real total Sprints till completion
- Create Stp estimations
  - Differtn policies (mean, overflow policy)
  - modify effort according to Influences
  

- Calculate Velocity/Sprint + project forecast (total Sprints till completion) for every Sprint
